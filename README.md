# Cheat-LuaScripts

* Q: Why did you make this repo?
* A:  I don't expect to get anything outside of Aimware but this repo is here just on the off chance that I happen to get anything else with lua/js support. e.g., [Aimware](https://aimware.net), [Onetap](https://onetap.su/), [Gamesense](https://gamesense.pub/), [Fatality](https://fatality.win), ect.
